## Resource Aim
This book guides learners through a range of projects, contextualised by cutting-edge themes including Machine Learning and Internet of Things. All projects are based on the Raspberry Pi Pico board, a cheap yet powerful device, which can be programmed in Python. 

## Learning Outcomes
- To explore artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques 
- To program a Pico using Python  
- To use and apply code from Github 
- To understand and apply Computer Science theory such as finite state machines and two’s complement 
- To use internet services to push data to visualisation services for interrogation  
- To learn and apply Computer Science techniques and theory using Jupyter notebooks 
- To use a vision sensor to respond to facial recognition triggers  
- To build a full physical device to solve a real-world problem 

## Resource structure
The book is separated into distinct projects that introduce concepts and techniques required to achieve the projects goals. The projects build in complexity. 

1. Getting Started  – this project introduces the Pico and all the hardware and applications needed  
2. Displaying Environmental Data – this project introduces data collection, storage and display 
3. Analysing Environmental Data – this project introduces Jupyter notebooks and data analysis  
4. The I in IoT – this project connects up the various elements needed for an IoT network 
5. Data Science for managing well-being – this project captures physical data and interrogates the data to make assertions and predictions regarding well-being 
6. Accessing data remotely – this project looks at how IoT technology can be used in Operational Technology in your home 
7. Experimenting with Physics – this projects measure ‘time of flight’ and building a model from the data 
8. Security starts at home – this project introduces facial recognition concepts and techniques
9. Bringing it all together – this is the capstone project where learners build an automated bird feeder that identifies and deters squirrels

## Inclusive Language Commitment
Arm is committed to making the language we use inclusive, meaningful, and respectful. Our goal is to remove and replace non-inclusive language from our vocabulary to reflect our values and represent our global ecosystem.

Arm is working actively with our partners, standards bodies, and the wider ecosystem to adopt a consistent approach to the use of inclusive language and to eradicate and replace offensive terms. We recognise that this will take time. This course may contain references to non-inclusive language; it will be updated with newer terms as those terms are agreed and ratified with the wider community.

Contact us at school@arm.com with questions or comments about this course. You can also report non-inclusive and offensive terminology usage in Arm content at terms@arm.com.
